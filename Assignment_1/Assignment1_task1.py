#Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

#1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
number1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
number2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))

#2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
print(f"Addition: {number1 + number2}")
print(f"Subtraction: {number1 - number2}")
print(f"Multiplication: {number1 * number2}")
print(f"Division: {number1 / number2}")
